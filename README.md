# ü§ñ AI-Powered-Dermatology-Assistant

This is an Agentic AI application that leverages a CNN-based deep learning model to classify skin diseases and integrates Azure OpenAI (GPT-35 Turbo) with LangChain and Azure AI Search to generate intelligent, context-aware healthcare recommendations.It is Designed to empower users with early self-diagnosis of skin disorders, the platform combines AI-driven accuracy with actionable insights for better health outcomes. The backend, built with Django REST Framework, ensures robust API orchestration, while the React.js frontend delivers an intuitive user experience. For data management, we implemented a scalable pipeline using Microsoft Fabric to ingest and transform raw data from Azure PostgreSQL, followed by the creation of a semantic model for structured analytics. Then processed data we visualized through interactive Power BI dashboards, enabling clear trend analysis and decision-making. The entire solution‚Äîspanning AI/ML workflows, data pipelines, and the web application‚Äîis securely deployed on Azure, ensuring end-to-end scalability and integration.

## üñ•Ô∏è UI/UX of the aplication

- Our intuitive React-based web application, deployed on Azure App Services, empowers users to take control of their skin health through AI-driven diagnosis. Users can simply upload or drag-and-drop images of affected skin areas, describe their symptoms, and click "Get Diagnosis" to receive instant analysis.

- The application leverages a CNN model for accurate image classification and integrates Azure OpenAI (GPT-35 Turbo) to provide conversational, evidence-based insights‚Äîenabling users to ask follow-up questions for deeper clarity. Every interaction is preserved, ensuring seamless continuity in symptom tracking and healthcare guidance.

- Designed for accessibility and early detection, this tool bridges the gap between users and proactive skin care, transforming how people approach dermatological health‚Äîone smart diagnosis at a time.

### üîå Unified AI Medical Assistant Endpoint (/api/medical-assistant)

- The /api/medical-assistant endpoint serves as a unified interface for both image-based skin disease diagnosis and AI-powered medical conversations. When receiving an image, it processes it through a CNN model for classification and confidence scoring, while text inputs engage Azure OpenAI (GPT-35 Turbo) and LangChain‚Äîaugmented by Azure AI Search‚Äîto deliver contextual, evidence-based healthcare responses. The system intelligently routes requests based on input type and maintains persistent chat history in Azure PostgreSQL, enabling seamless continuity across sessions. Designed for efficiency, the endpoint integrates with Azure API Management for scalability and security, allowing users to transition effortlessly between uploading skin condition photos and asking follow-up questions‚Äîall within a single, cohesive interaction flow.

# üîÑ Routing

- The application employs dynamic routing to seamlessly process both image-based diagnoses and text-based medical conversations through a single, unified API endpoint (/api/medical-assistant). When a request is received, the system automatically detects the input type‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs an uploaded skin photo or a text query describing symptoms‚Äîand intelligently routes it to the appropriate AI model. Image inputs are analyzed by a CNN-based classifier, which generates a diagnosis along with confidence scores, while text inputs are processed by Azure OpenAI (GPT-35 Turbo) enhanced with LangChain and Azure AI Search to deliver accurate, context-aware medical responses. This streamlined approach ensures users can effortlessly transition between submitting visual diagnostics and asking follow-up questions, all within a single, intuitive interaction flow.

# ‚õìÔ∏è Prompt Chaining

- **Contextual follow-up**:If the user asks a follow-up question (e.g., "How to treat this?"), the system chains prompts by:

      Retrieving the prior diagnosis from chat history (Azure PostgreSQL).

  Injecting it into a new GPT-35 Turbo prompt:
  "The user has psoriasis (92% confidence). Provide a concise treatment plan using data from Azure AI Search, including topical treatments and lifestyle advice."

- **Multi-modal integration**:For complex queries (e.g., "Is this contagious?"), the system combines:Image analysis results (from CNN), Medical guidelines (from Azure AI Search) and Conversational context (from chat history)
  .

  Example chained prompt:
  "Based on the user's psoriasis diagnosis (image-attached), explain contagion risks and prevention steps. Cite dermatology guidelines."

# üß† Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Medical AI

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** enhances the AI‚Äôs responses by grounding them in up-to-date, authoritative medical knowledge‚Äîcombining the reasoning of **Azure OpenAI (GPT-35 Turbo)** with targeted data retrieval from **Azure AI Search**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Knowledge Retrieval

**Medical Corpus:**  
Azure AI Search indexes trusted sources such as clinical guidelines, research papers, or drug databases.

**Contextual Queries:**  
When a user asks, _"What‚Äôs the first-line treatment for psoriasis?"_, LangChain:

- Converts the question into a search query.
- Fetches relevant excerpts (e.g., _"Topical corticosteroids are preferred for mild psoriasis..."_).

---

RAG transforms the AI from a chatbot into a **context-aware medical assistant**‚Äîbridging the gap between LLMs and clinical expertise.
